# Run lint-staged for formatting staged files
pnpm lint-staged

# Run full lint check (errors only, warnings allowed)
pnpm lint

# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Note: TypeScript check (pnpm check) has pre-existing errors in Svelte routes
# that need to be addressed in a separate refactoring effort.
# The build process (pnpm build) performs its own type checking.
